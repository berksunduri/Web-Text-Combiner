This code defines a static method named combineTexts that takes an array of Strings texts as input and returns a single concatenated String as output.

Here's how the method works:

The method first checks if the input array texts is null or has a length of zero. If it is, the method returns an empty string.

If the texts array has at least one element, the first element is assigned to a variable named result.

Then, the method iterates over the remaining elements of the texts array using a for loop, starting at index 1.

For each element in the texts array, the method looks for the longest overlap between the current result string and the current element in the texts array.

If an overlap is found, the method appends the non-overlapping portion of the current element to the result string.

If no overlap is found, the entire current element is appended to the result string.

After all elements have been processed in this way, the final result string is returned as the output of the method.

In essence, this method combines the strings in the texts array by finding the common overlaps between adjacent strings and merging them together, resulting in a single concatenated string that contains all the original strings without any redundant text.
